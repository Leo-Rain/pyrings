=======

Python package to handle rings/eddies in the ocean

Procedures to deal with coherent vortexes, rings/eddies in general.

A set of functions and classes to deal with rings/eddies identified by the velocity field. It does not require any specific data distribution, i.e. works fine with irregularly distributed data, like ship tracks.

The center is estimated and the data is re-estructured to a natural coordinate system.
